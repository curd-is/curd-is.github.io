# Donald Duck
Donald is something of a prankster, and as a result, he can sometimes come across as a bit of a bully, especially in the way he sometimes treats Chip n' Dale and Huey, Dewey and Louie, his nephews.
However, with a few exceptions, there is seldom any harm in Donald's pranks. He almost never intends to hurt anyone, and whenever his pranks go too far, he is always very apologetic. In Truant Officer Donald, for example, when he is tricked into believing he has accidentally killed Huey, Dewey, and Louie, he shows great regret, blaming himself. His nephews appear in the form of angels, and he willingly endures a kick by one of themâ€”that is, of course, until he realizes he has been tricked, whereupon he promptly loses his temper.
